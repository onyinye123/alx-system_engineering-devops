Title: DevOps Incident Postmortem: Docker Container Outage

Issue Summary:

Duration: 2 hours, from 2023-05-11 14:00 UTC to 2023-05-11 16:00 UTC.
Impact: The containerized service "" experienced a"system nginx" complete outage during the incident. Users were unable to access the service, resulting in a 100% service disruption. User experience was severely affected, with all users unable to perform any actions within the application.

Timeline:

2023-05-11 14:00 UTC: The issue was detected when the monitoring system triggered an alert for the unavailability of the "system nginx" service.
The investigation began immediately after receiving the alert.
Initially, the investigation focused on network connectivity issues and Docker host health checks as possible root causes.
Misleading investigation paths included examining the load balancer configuration and checking for any issues with external dependencies.
The incident was escalated to the DevOps team lead and the system architect for further assistance.
Additional debugging efforts were undertaken, including reviewing container logs and resource allocation.
Root Cause and Resolution:
Root Cause: The root cause of the outage was identified as a misconfiguration in the container orchestration platform. A recent update to the platform introduced a configuration change that caused service containers to fail during startup.

Resolution: To resolve the issue, the DevOps team rolled back the recent configuration change, reverting the container orchestration platform to its previous stable version. Once rolled back, the service containers started successfully, and the application was restored to full functionality.

Corrective and Preventative Measures:
Improvements/Fixes:

Enhance monitoring capabilities to include detailed health checks and alerts specifically for container startup failures.
Implement stricter testing and validation processes for container orchestration platform updates to catch potential configuration issues before deployment.
Establish clear communication channels and escalation paths within the team to ensure timely incident response.
Tasks:

Update the monitoring system to include container startup checks for critical services.
Review and enhance testing procedures for future container orchestration platform updates.
Conduct a post-incident review meeting with the team to identify lessons learned and document best practices.
Develop a comprehensive incident response plan, including clear roles and responsibilities for each team member.
In conclusion, the Docker container outage was caused by a misconfiguration introduced during a recent update to the container orchestration platform. The incident was promptly detected by the monitoring system, and investigation efforts were initiated. Misleading paths were explored before identifying the root cause. The incident was escalated to higher levels, and a rollback of the configuration change resolved the issue. To prevent similar incidents in the future, monitoring capabilities will be enhanced, testing procedures will be strengthened, and a comprehensive incident response plan will be developed and implemented.

By following these corrective measures, we aim to improve the stability and reliability of our containerized services, ensuring uninterrupted access for our users.

Aside from the fields for details such as the date of the review meeting and the employees involved, this template asks four key questions:
What happened?
What was the impact of the incident?
Why did it happen?
What were the lessons learned?
After completing that reflection process, action items are added at the bottom of the post-mortem template and assigned to individual owners.
